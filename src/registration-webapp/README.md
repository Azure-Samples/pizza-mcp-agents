## Overview

This website provides a registration interface so that users can obtain a unique `userId` to access the Pizza API once authenticated through either a GitHub or Microsoft account. This application is built using [Azure Static Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/) and uses the Azure Functions Registration API to handle user registration and token generation.

## Development

### Setup development environment

You can run this project directly in your browser by using GitHub Codespaces, which will open a web-based VS Code.

1. [**Fork**](https://github.com/Microsoft/open-hack-build-25/fork) the project to create your own copy of this repository.
2. On your forked repository, select the **Code** button, then the **Codespaces** tab, and click on the button **Create codespace on main**.

3. Wait for the Codespace to be created, it should take a few minutes.

If you prefer to run the project locally, follow [these instructions](../../README.md#use-your-local-environment).

### Run the application

You can run the following command to run the application locally:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) development server, the Azure Functions emulator with the registration API, and the [Azure Static Web Apps CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/static-web-apps-cli-overview) authentication emulator. This will allow you to test the website locally, using the URL `http://localhost:4280`.
