## Overview

This is the Pizza API, a serverless API that allows you to order delicious pizzas with various toppings. The API is designed to be simple and easy to use, providing endpoints for accessing pizza and topping information, placing orders, and managing your pizza experience.

The API is built with [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-javascript).

## API Endpoints

The Pizza API provides the following endpoints:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | /api | Returns basic server status information including active and total orders |
| GET | /api/openapi | Returns the OpenAPI specification in YAML format (add `?format=json` for JSON) |
| GET | /api/pizzas | Returns a list of all pizzas |
| GET | /api/pizzas/{id} | Retrieves a specific pizza by its ID |
| GET | /api/toppings | Returns a list of all toppings (can be filtered by category with ?category=X) |
| GET | /api/toppings/{id} | Retrieves a specific topping by its ID |
| GET | /api/toppings/categories | Returns a list of all topping categories |
| GET | /api/orders | Returns a list of all orders in the system |
| POST | /api/orders | Places a new order with pizzas (requires `userId`) |
| GET | /api/orders/{orderId} | Retrieves an order by its ID |
| DELETE | /api/orders/{orderId} | Cancels an order if it has not yet been started (status must be 'pending', requires `userId` as a query parameter (e.g., `?userId={userId}`) |
| GET | /api/images/{filepath} | Retrieves image files (e.g., /api/images/pizzas/pizza-1.jpg) |

### Filtering orders

The `GET /api/orders` endpoint supports the following optional query parameters:

- `userId`: Filter orders by user ID.
- `status`: Filter by order status. You can provide multiple statuses as a comma-separated list (e.g. `pending,ready`).
- `last`: Filter orders created in the last X minutes or hours (e.g. `last=60m` for 60 minutes, `last=2h` for 2 hours).

**Note:** The `userId` property is never included in any order response for privacy reasons.

**Examples:**

```
GET /api/orders?userId=user123
GET /api/orders?status=pending,ready
GET /api/orders?last=2h
GET /api/orders?userId=user123&status=completed&last=60m
```

You can view the complete API documentation by opening the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=http://localhost:7071/api/openapi) or the [OpenAPI YAML file](http://localhost:7071/api/openapi).


### Order Limits

A user can have a maximum of **5 active orders** (status: `pending` or `in-preparation`) at a time. If you try to place more, the API will return:

- HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
- Body: `{ "error": "Too many active orders: limit is 5 per user" }`

This ensures fair use and prevents abuse.

### Order Status Automation

Order statuses are updated automatically by a timer function every 40 seconds:
- Orders move from 'pending' to 'in-preparation' 1-3 minutes after creation.
- Orders move from 'in-preparation' to 'ready' within 3 minutes around their estimated completion time. When an order is ready, the `readyAt` property is set to the ready timestamp (ISO date string).
- Orders move from 'ready' to 'completed' 1-2 minutes after being ready. When an order is completed, the `completedAt` property is set to the completion timestamp (ISO date string).

Estimated completion time is calculated as:
- 3-5 minutes for 1-2 pizzas, plus 1 minute for each additional pizza.

No manual API call is needed for these transitions.

## Development

### Setup development environment

You can run this project directly in your browser by using GitHub Codespaces, which will open a web-based VS Code.

1. [**Fork**](https://github.com/Microsoft/open-hack-build-25/fork) the project to create your own copy of this repository.
2. On your forked repository, select the **Code** button, then the **Codespaces** tab, and clink on the button **Create codespace on main**.
   ![Screenshot showing how to create a new codespace](../../docs/images/codespaces.png?raw=true)
3. Wait for the Codespace to be created, it should take a few minutes.

If you prefer to run the project locally, follow [these instructions](../../README.md#use-your-local-environment).

### Run the application

You can run the following command to run the application locally:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the Azure Functions application locally. You can test the application by opening the file `api.http` and click on **Send Request** to test the endpoints.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not deployed the Azure resources, it will fall back to in-memory data. You can test the API without deploying it to Azure.
